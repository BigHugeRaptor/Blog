This is just a way to track my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Couldn't find another way to do it, so for now, here I am!

<u>5/1/17</u>
<p>Welcome to how I'll be keeping track of my progress! This will also be a good way for me to proactice making brances and merging them. Go go muscle memory.</p>
<p>I am writing this entry the day after (I came up with the idea last night). Yesterday I added row columns to my portfolio so that I could show the three games I worked on.</p>
<p>The issue I came across was that I didn't design my persistent navigation header with Bootstrap and I did design the pictures/captions with Bootstrap. As such, when I scrolled down the page, my images were appearing on top of the header. To fix this, I'll need to convert the header into bootstrap. Adam pointed that out to me.</p>
<p>So the lesson of the day was, code of a feather plays well togther, different codes will errode.</p>
